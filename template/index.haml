    You have reached the domain of ~devyn. How can I help you?
  :redcloth
    Just kidding. You see, this is _my_ website. Not _yours_. At any rate, this is my home page. Because I can never stay put [except when I'm sitting at my desk, on the computer], I spread out all my stuff across the internets.

    However, a major problem came out of that: there is no central location to look at all of my stuff! So, this page serves as a place where you can stare in amazement at the various works of ~devyn! So, without further ado, I give you.... my website!
